# MandelbrotGL

A minimal mandelbrot set fractal explorer powered by GPU computation using OpenGL.

## Features

- GPU computation

### Request

- Smooth movement (as opposed to raw key repeats)
- Event based key input, rather than reading from a state buffer
- Mouse control
- Color range grows, so that image gains detail rather than change altogether when up-ing iteration count
- Use integer type texture to store compute data
